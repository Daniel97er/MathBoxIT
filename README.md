## Description:
Mathematical tools for informatics (A program which I programmed after the mathematics and cryptography lecture to practice math, cryptography and
 programming) This program is created only to learn and not for efficiency functions. No teacher checked the programming functions so there
can be errors, to be sure to have correct results use tested programs and nothing here! I program this with Python, Flask Framework, Jinja, HTML and CSS. 

### Miller-Rabin-Test
This test check if a number is prime or not. If Miller_Rabin_Test answer is false so the number is not prime. If the answer is true so the number is most likely prime (Miller-Rabin-Test with 15 repeats in this program is high).
