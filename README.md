## Description:
Mathematical tools for informatics (A program which I programmed after the mathematics and cryptography lecture to practice math, cryptography and
programming) This program is created only to learn and not for efficiency functions. No teacher checked the functions so there can be errors. I program
this with Python, Flask Framework, Jinja, HTML and CSS.
