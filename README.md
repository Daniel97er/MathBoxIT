## Description:
Mathematical tools for informatics (A program which I programmed after the mathematics and cryptography lecture to practice math, cryptography and
programming) This program is created only to learn and not for efficiency functions. No teacher checked the programming functions so there
can be errors, to be sure to have correct results use tested programs and nothing here! I program this with Python, Flask Framework, Jinja, HTML and CSS. 

## Math functions

### Miller-Rabin-Test (probabilistic primality test)
This test check if a number is prime or not. If Miller_Rabin_Test answer is false so the number is not prime. If the answer is true so the number is most
likely prime (Miller-Rabin-Test with 15 repeats in this program is high). 

### Prime factors
This test breaks down a number into its prime factors. 

### ISBN-10-Test 
This test check if a ISBN-10 number is valid. Enter here the number without space or other signs.

### Euclidean algorithm 
This algorithm checks with modulo calculating wbich is the great commen divisior of two entered numbers.

### Extended Euclidean algorithm
This algorithm calculate the great common divisior and reconstruct a linear combination with the two entered numbers Equalizer to the great common divisor.

### Chinese remainder theorem 
With this algorithm we can get the smallest natural number which meets the following conditions. From a list of equations which looks like:
(X congruent number mod)
<br>
<br>
(X congruent 4 mod7)
<br>
(X congruent 3 mod5)
<br>
(X congruent 5 mod2)
<br>
<br>
When the mods are all coprime the chinese remainder function can find the smallest number X which solves the conditions.
<br>
<br>
To use the function enter the numbers in the following format:
<br>
Number list:4 3 5
<br>
Mod list:7 5 2

### Gaussian elimination
This algorithm solves a linear system of equations like below to line step shape.
<br>
<br>
3X + 5Y = 0
5X + 9Y = 0
<br>
<br>
To use the function enter the numbers as a matrix but in one line:
<br> 
Matrix:3 5 5 9

### Finite prime field division
This function do a division in a finite prime field
